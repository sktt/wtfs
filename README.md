# Whats the 2d?

This is an infinite work in progress of making a 3d-ish game environment

Inspiration from Adventure game studio, but this one is for HTML5 webgl canvas

## Whats here so far?

#### Level development
- Basic polygon path editing
- Initial camera position editing
- World background scale

#### Game
- Pathfinding in polygon by creating a visiblity graph
- Sprite sheet animation in a given FPS <= 60
- Walkbehind area (omg here is 3d-ish)

## Tech stack
- ES7
- Flowtype
- Rendering with PIXI.js
- Level building using React svg
- User interaction handling and (some) dataflow using event-emitter and RxJS
- Webpack with hmr
